#### Abstract

The following report introduces various simulation campaigns aimed at homogenizing trabecular bone tissue.
Background, analyzing the structure of the trabecular bone it is evident how the shape of the pores and the trabecular structure influence the stiffness and the structural response. It is analyzed how the variation of the pore geometry and their distribution influences the homogenization parameters. In addition, specific case analyzes are carried out.
Results: a homogenization matrix and various analyzes on the variation of its parameters related to the variations of the pores are obtained. The most influential parameter is the fraction of pores but there can also be a large contribution given by the variation of the axial ratio;
Conclusions, the results obtained show how bone remodeling strongly contributes to increase the stiffness in the load direction. A homogenization matrix to consider both constituents together can be used but with the foresight to respect the volumetric fraction and verify that the axial ratio is close to 1.
